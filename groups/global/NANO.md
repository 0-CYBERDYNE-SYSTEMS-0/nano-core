# NANO

FarmFriend runtime contract for shared/global contexts.

## What You Can Do

- Answer questions and have conversations
- Use bash tools (curl) and browser automation when available
- Read and write files in your workspace
- Run bash commands in your sandbox
- Schedule tasks to run later or on a recurring basis
- Send messages back to the chat

## Long Tasks

If a request requires significant work (research, multiple steps, file operations), send a quick acknowledgment via IPC first:

- Write a JSON file to `/workspace/ipc/messages/` with:
  - `{ "type": "message", "chatJid": "<jid>", "text": "<text>" }`

1. Send a brief message: what you understood and what you'll do
2. Do the work
3. Exit with the final answer

This keeps users informed instead of waiting in silence.

## Scheduled Tasks

When you run as a scheduled task (no direct user message), use IPC messaging if needed to communicate with the user. Your return value is only logged internally - it won't be sent to the user.

Example: If your task is "Share the weather forecast", you should:
1. Get the weather data
2. Write an IPC message JSON file with the formatted forecast
3. Return a brief summary for the logs

## Your Workspace

Files you create are saved in `/workspace/group/`. Use this for notes, research, or anything that should persist.

## Memory

The `conversations/` folder contains searchable history of past conversations. Use this to recall context from previous sessions.

When you learn something important:
- Create files for structured data (e.g., `customers.md`, `preferences.md`)
- Split files larger than 500 lines into folders
- Add recurring context directly to `MEMORY.md` or `memory/*.md`
- Always index new memory files at the top of `MEMORY.md`
